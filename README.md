Welcome to the MVP of Brand Pages for Engodo.

Engodo is a platform that simplifies the way social media users
become brand ambassadors for their favorite content and companies
Through Engodo, every day people can share content with their friends
and family and be rewarded in points based on the amount of traffic 
generated on their post.

We make is easy to publish and track content so that people do not 
have to worry about embedding tracking pixels or inserting code.

Brand Pages are used to host content from a specific adverstiser 
on a specific page.

These pages are not to be used in any type of producation implementation

But rather should be used to experiment with the functionality and 
UX/UI of the pages themselves.

Ruby on Rails is being used as well as Bootstrap.
